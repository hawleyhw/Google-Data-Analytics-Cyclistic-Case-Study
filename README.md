# Google-Data-Analytics-Cyclistic-Case-Study

## Introduction

I will be performing real world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company called Cyclistic, located in Chicago. I will follow the steps provided by Google's Data Analytics Certification, which are Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## Background

Cyclistic, a successful Chicago bike-share program with over 5,800 bicycles and 692 stations, is looking to increase its profitability by maximizing annual memberships. Currently, they offer various pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. While their flexible pricing attracts a wide range of riders, data suggests annual members are more valuable customers.

The Challenge:

The marketing team, led by Director Lily Moreno, believes there's an opportunity to convert casual riders (single-ride/day pass users) into annual members. Casual riders are already familiar with Cyclistic and have chosen them for their transportation needs.

The Goal:

Develop targeted marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

Key to Success:

Understanding the usage patterns of casual riders vs. annual members through data analysis of historical bike trip data. This will help identify what motivates casual riders and how digital media can be leveraged to influence their decision-making.

Stakeholders:

Cyclistic Marketing Team: Analyze data and develop marketing strategies.
Lily Moreno: Director of Marketing, responsible for campaign development.
Cyclistic Executive Team: Approves or rejects the marketing program based on data insights.
